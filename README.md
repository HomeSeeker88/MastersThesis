My master's thesis regarding NLP and GAN
To run everything besides Model.R run this command:

install.packages(c("tidytext". "tidyverse", "ggraph", "igraph", "wordcloud", "reshape2", "shiny", "shinydashboard", "plotly"))

Installing keras and tensorflow is a little bit more complex so instructions for that will appear later.
